# MWD_Outsystems
MetalWeaves Designs is a craft shop inventory and transactions backoffice administration webapplication. 
The application was created for MetalWeaves Designs, a small chain maille craft company.

It is an Outsystems 11 application with an internal database (Microsoft SQL Server).
We intend to have both a BackOffice and a FrontOffice, however in this first version we do not yet have a FrontOffice.
Created as a living project with a 4-layer Canvas architecture, expect a newer version of MWD_Outsystems regulary with more functionality and better code architecture.

This repository contains an Outsystems Application export file (oap).
The application is read-only and may be loaded for this purpose in a valid Outsystems 11 Service Studio environment.
